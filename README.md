### This is Shae Smith's submission for the Trala takehome assignment.

# To run

- If running with the fake data provided in the assignment, simply run the test sweet by running `npm run test` at the root of this project

- If running with an external data source you can update that file with the proper json.

** NOTE - I have updated the JSON and the code to expect that all the data is embedded in a "data" prop. This made it more convient for working with the data however, ANY JSON used will need to have this `data` property.**
